## Your data is safe

This tool is designed to not leak any of your information, including any personal information as defined under the GDPR. When you run Rankquest Studio, it runs in your browser. 

Except for the search plugins, this application does not make any network requests. There is no Ranquest server. There is no server side database.

## Cookies and Browser Local Storage

This application stores configuration, rated searches, etc. in the browser local storage in json form. This is fully under your control. To delete your data, simply erase this website from your browser history. There is no server side storage for your data. The browser side data is all there is.

## No Analytics

This application currently does not use any web analytics (Google analytics or similar). All cookies, localstorage, etc. in the app are used only for the core functionality of this application. Should this change in the future, we will update this policy.

Requests to the webserver to fetch the assets related to this website are logged by the hosting provider. Rankquest Studio is currently hosted by [Versio](https://www.versio.nl). You can of course self host rankquest on your own server. Simply download and build the source code from [Github](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/rankquest-studio).

## Network traffic

The included search plugins of course make requests to any search services that you configure. Always make sure you have 
the permission from the owners of these services to make such requests. Running metrics may impose a significant load on a server.
